### EP Structured Variational Auto-Encoders

This repository contains experimental code to accompany the paper "EP Structured Variational Auto-Encoders", submitted for the 2018 Symposium on Approximate Bayesian Inference.

The code is largely based on, and has been forked from, https://github.com/mattjj/svae.  We would like to express our thanks to Matt Johnson et al. for making the original SVAE code publicly available.

A summary of differences from the SVAE codebase can be seen at https://github.com/jonny-so/svae/compare/master...epsvae
